# Scripts Directory

Utility scripts for managing NixOS configuration and services.

## Claude Code Hook Scripts

These scripts are used by Claude Code hooks (see `.claude/settings.json`) to enforce code quality and safety standards.

### `block-dangerous-commands.sh`

**Hook**: PreToolUse (Bash)
**Purpose**: Blocks dangerous commands before execution

**Blocked operations**:

- System rebuilds (`nh os switch`, `nixos-rebuild`, `darwin-rebuild`)
- Destructive file operations (`rm -rf`, `mv to /dev/null`)
- Git force operations (`git push --force`, `git reset --hard`)
- Production host access (patterns: `prod*`, `production*`, `*-prod`, `*-production`)

**Exit codes**:

- `0`: Command allowed
- `2`: Command blocked (shown to Claude)

### `auto-format-nix.sh`

**Hook**: PostToolUse (Write|Edit)
**Purpose**: Automatically formats Nix files after editing

**Behavior**:

- Runs `nixfmt` on all `.nix` files after Write/Edit operations
- Blocks (exit 2) if formatting fails (indicates syntax errors)
- Skips non-Nix files silently

**Requirements**: `nixfmt` must be in PATH (available in `nix develop`)

### `strict-lint-check.sh`

**Hook**: PostToolUse (Write|Edit)
**Purpose**: Enforces code quality standards and architectural guidelines

**Checks**:

- **statix**: Nix antipattern detection
- **deadnix**: Unused code detection
- **with pkgs;**: Antipattern from CLAUDE.md
- **Module placement**: Validates system vs home-manager separation

**Exit codes**:

- `0`: All checks passed
- `2`: Issues found (blocks Claude, requires fixes)

### `load-context.sh`

**Hook**: SessionStart
**Purpose**: Loads project context when Claude Code starts

**Output** (added to Claude's context):

- Current git branch
- Last 3 commits
- Working tree status

**Performance**: Minimal overhead (~100ms)

## qBittorrent & ProtonVPN Scripts

**Usage:**

```bash
# Run monitoring
./scripts/monitor-protonvpn-portforward.sh

# Or with custom namespace
NAMESPACE=qbt ./scripts/monitor-protonvpn-portforward.sh
```

**Checks:**

1. VPN namespace exists
2. WireGuard interface status
3. VPN connectivity (gateway ping, external IP)
4. NAT-PMP port forwarding
5. qBittorrent service status
6. qBittorrent configuration (port, interface binding)
7. Listening ports in namespace
8. Recent service logs

**Exit codes:**

# One-time report
./scripts/monitor-hdd-storage.sh

# Continuous monitoring
./scripts/monitor-hdd-storage.sh --continuous --interval 10
```

**Checks:**

- Disk space usage (SSD staging, HDD storage)
- HDD I/O utilization
- Service status
- Temperature readings (if available)

For complete qBittorrent setup and troubleshooting, see `docs/QBITTORRENT_GUIDE.md`.

## Network Performance Scripts

### `optimize-mtu.sh`

Automatically discover and optimize MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) for regular network and VPN interfaces using Path MTU Discovery.

**Usage:**

```bash
# Test both regular network and VPN (recommended)
sudo ./scripts/optimize-mtu.sh

# Test only VPN (prioritize qBittorrent/VPN performance)
sudo ./scripts/optimize-mtu.sh --vpn-only

# Test only regular network
sudo ./scripts/optimize-mtu.sh --regular-only

# Test and apply settings
sudo ./scripts/optimize-mtu.sh --apply

# Dry-run to see recommendations
sudo ./scripts/optimize-mtu.sh --apply --dry-run
```

**What it does:**

1. Uses binary search with ping + "Don't Fragment" flag to find optimal MTU
2. Tests both regular network interface and VPN namespace
3. Discovers the largest packet size that doesn't fragment
4. Provides specific recommendations for:
   - NixOS configuration (`networking.interfaces.<iface>.mtu`)
   - WireGuard configuration (`MTU = <value>` in SOPS secret)
   - UniFi Dream Machine setup (DHCP options or per-port settings)

**How it works:**

- Sends ping packets with increasing sizes and DF (Don't Fragment) flag
- Uses binary search to efficiently find optimal MTU (typically 8-12 tests)
- Accounts for IP/ICMP header overhead (28 bytes)
- Tests against reliable hosts (1.1.1.1 for regular, 8.8.8.8 for VPN)

**Output:**

- Current MTU vs Optimal MTU for each interface
- Status indicators (✓ OPTIMAL or ⚠️ NEEDS ADJUSTMENT)
- Configuration recommendations with exact values
- Verification commands to test after applying

**Critical for VPN:**

Proper MTU is essential for VPN performance! WireGuard adds ~80 bytes overhead, so MTU must be lowered to avoid fragmentation. The script automatically accounts for this.

**UniFi Dream Machine Integration:**

The script provides two methods for applying MTU on UniFi:

1. Network-wide via DHCP Option 26
2. Per-port in device settings (recommended for specific devices)

## Requirements

Most scripts require:

- `bash` (standard)
- `iproute2` for network namespace operations
- `libnatpmp` for NAT-PMP queries (`natpmpc` command)
- `systemd` for service management
- `curl` for external connectivity tests

Install missing dependencies:

```bash
nix-shell -p libnatpmp
```

## Automation

The ProtonVPN port forwarding can be automated via systemd timer. Enable in your NixOS configuration:

```nix
host.services.mediaManagement.qbittorrent.vpn.portForwarding = {
  enable = true;  # Default: true when VPN is enabled
  renewInterval = "45min";  # Default: 45 minutes
  gateway = "10.2.0.1";  # Default: ProtonVPN gateway
};
```

Check timer status:

```bash
systemctl status protonvpn-portforward.timer
systemctl list-timers | grep protonvpn
```

View logs:

```bash
journalctl -u protonvpn-portforward.service -f
```

## Troubleshooting

**Port forwarding not working:**

1. Run verification: `./scripts/verify-qbittorrent-vpn.sh`
2. Check monitoring: `./scripts/monitor-protonvpn-portforward.sh`
3. View logs: `journalctl -u protonvpn-portforward -u qbittorrent -f`

**NAT-PMP errors:**

- Ensure VPN namespace exists: `ip netns list`
- Check VPN connectivity: `sudo ip netns exec qbt ping 10.2.0.1`
- Verify `natpmpc` is installed: `which natpmpc`

**qBittorrent not updating:**

- Check config permissions: `ls -la /var/lib/qBittorrent/`
- Verify service can write: `systemctl cat qbittorrent.service | grep ReadWrite`
- Check service status: `systemctl status qbittorrent`

**VPN namespace issues:**

- Check VPN service: `systemctl status qbt`
- View WireGuard status: `sudo ip netns exec qbt wg show`
- Verify SOPS secrets are decrypted: `ls -la /run/secrets/`
