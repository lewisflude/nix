# nvfetcher configuration for overlay sources
# Run: nvfetcher -c overlays/sources.toml -o overlays/_sources
# This generates overlays/_sources/generated.nix with updated hashes
#
# Note: For packages that require additional hashes (like npmDepsHash),
# you'll still need to update those manually after building.

# Example: Add more overlay sources here as needed
# [another-package]
# src.github = "owner/repo"
# fetch.github = "owner=owner,repo=repo"
# git.tag = "latest"  # or git.branch = "main"
