## 🎯 Your First Curation Session (30 minutes)

**Goal:** Organize your KICK-3 kicks by genre (Techno/House/DnB)

### What You'll Do:

1. **Open your Samsung Drive in Finder:**
   ```
   open "/Volumes/Samsung Drive/Ableton/Presets/_By-Vendor/Instruments/KICK-3/"
   ```

2. **For each KICK-3 volume folder:**
   - Listen to 5-10 presets
   - Ask: "Is this Techno, House, or DnB?"
   - Copy to appropriate genre folder:
     ```
     _By-Function/01-Drums/Kicks/_Genre/Techno/Peak-Time/
     _By-Function/01-Drums/Kicks/_Genre/House/Deep/
     _By-Function/01-Drums/Kicks/_Genre/DnB/Neurofunk/
     ```

3. **Start with Vol.5 (Techno)** - easiest to categorize

4. **After 30 minutes, you'll have:**
   - 20-30 kicks organized by genre
   - Immediate workflow improvement
   - Understanding of how the system works

## 📊 What to Expect

### Before Curation
- Folders exist but are empty
- Vendor folders still work (in `_By-Vendor/`)
- System is ready for you to populate

### After First Session (30 min)
- 20-30 kicks organized
- You can browse by genre in Ableton
- 5-10x faster kick discovery

### After Full Curation (4-6 hours over 2 weeks)
- All presets organized
- All MIDI organized
- Professional workflow

## 🎵 Key Principle

**"Copy, don't move"** - The same preset can live in multiple places:

```
Example: A "punchy techno kick" can be in:
├── _Genre/Techno/Peak-Time/     (find by genre)
└── _Type/Punchy-Clicky/         (find by character)
```

This is **multi-dimensional organization** - find sounds from different angles.
