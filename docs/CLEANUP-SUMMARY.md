# Cleanup Summary - Cross-Platform Keyboard Configuration

**Date:** 2025-10-12  
**Task:** Cleanup and finalization of cross-platform keyboard setup

---

## ‚úÖ Cleanup Actions Completed

### Critical Discovery

**Position Numbering Error Found and Corrected:**
- Documentation incorrectly referenced Caps Lock as **position 75**
- Actual Caps Lock position is **position 51** (verified via JSON analysis)
- All 5 affected documentation files corrected
- Firmware was already optimal (no changes needed)

### Files Removed

1. **`docs/reference/mnk88-firmware-changelog.md`** (5KB)
   - **Reason:** Duplicate/outdated
   - **Replaced by:** `docs/reference/mnk88-firmware-status.md` (11KB)
   - **Why:** The new file is more comprehensive, includes verification instructions, and covers cross-platform considerations

### Files Updated

1. **`docs/guides/KEYBOARD-README.md`**
   - Added cross-platform designation
   - Updated quick navigation links
   - Added new documentation references (macOS, cross-platform, cheatsheet)
   - Updated architecture diagram to show universal firmware

2. **`docs/README.md`**
   - Reorganized keyboard section with clear categories:
     - Quick Start (2 docs)
     - Platform-Specific (3 docs)
     - Complete Documentation (6 docs)
     - Technical (3 docs)
     - Legacy (3 docs)
   - Added missing links: accessibility, learning-curve, cheatsheet, deployment, firmware-status
   - Better grouping for discoverability

3. **Position Reference Corrections** (5 files)
   - `docs/guides/keyboard-quickstart.md` - Position 75 ‚Üí 51
   - `docs/guides/keyboard-cross-platform.md` - Position 75 ‚Üí 51 (2 instances)
   - `docs/guides/keyboard-macos.md` - Position 75 ‚Üí 51
   - `docs/guides/KEYBOARD-README.md` - Position 75 ‚Üí 51
   - `docs/reference/mnk88-firmware-status.md` - Position 75 ‚Üí 51 (multiple instances)

### Files Verified as Optimal

1. **`docs/reference/mnk88-universal.layout.json`**
   - ‚úÖ Position 51: `KC_CAPS` (Caps Lock - correct for OS-level remapping)
   - ‚úÖ F13-F16: Present and bindable
   - ‚úÖ Position 81: `MO(2)` (Right Shift for Layer 2 screenshots)
   - ‚úÖ Winkeyless layout: Positions 65-67, 84-88, 89 = `KC_NO`
   - **Status:** No changes needed, already optimal for cross-platform use
   - **NOTE:** Previous docs incorrectly stated position 75 - corrected to 51
