# Nix Configuration Overview

This repository hosts a flake-based Nix setup for both macOS and Linux. Home Manager modules are shared across platforms and development shells under `shells/` provide reproducible environments. Use `nix fmt` before committing and `nix flake check` to verify evaluation.

Secrets are stored in `secrets/` using SOPS, and helper functions live in `lib/`.
